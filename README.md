# CIS445_545_HW2
Homework for CIS445

Made the homepage for a profile using git add ., git commit, git push and the merge/pull request version on github.

I first added an image to the website and a header. After this I decided to put in paragraphs and add a container, so as to have a little bit of a more visually pleasing look.
After the gridbox was done, I wrote what I wanted and put everything on github.
