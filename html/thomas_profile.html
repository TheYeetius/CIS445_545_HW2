                <div id="border-paragraph">
                    <p>After elementary school I started middle/high school in the Netherlands. 
                        The Netherlands has a different education system then the American education system.
                        The middle school and high school are combined into one school. I started studying originally
                        for biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences and took a bundle of courses in high school that matched this plan.
                        However, I had one course that diverted from the biology and pharmaceutical bundle, and this was computer science.
                        After following a study related to the medical field for a year, I dropped out and started the computer science study.
                        I have now studied computer science for 3 years and am in my final/senior year of school.
                        Since I'm from the Netherlands, Bradley University isn't where I study primarly. At home I study at the HAN, university of applied sciences.
